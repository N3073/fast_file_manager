# fast_file_manager
My personal take on what a file manager should be like.
I was inspired to make this project by my frustration with the windows' file manager.
1. Wiundows' file manager is slow
2. Can't remove stuff from clipboard without remaking the selection.
3. Can't see what the clipboard contains.
